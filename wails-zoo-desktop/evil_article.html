    <h1>The Nature of Evil: A Philosophical Exploration</h1>
    
    <p>Evil has been one of humanity's most enduring philosophical puzzles. Throughout history, thinkers, theologians, and artists have grappled with its nature, origins, and implications. What is evil? Where does it come from? Can it be eradicated, or is it an inescapable part of the human condition?</p>

    <h2>Defining Evil</h2>
    <p>The concept of evil transcends simple definitions. In common parlance, evil describes actions or qualities that cause harm, suffering, or destruction. Yet philosophers distinguish between <em>moral evil</em>—the result of human free will—and <em>natural evil</em>, such as earthquakes or diseases that occur independently of human agency.</p>

        "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." — Edmund Burke
    </div>

    <h2>Philosophical Perspectives</h2>
    <p>In Western philosophy, Plato viewed evil as a form of ignorance—no one does evil willingly, but rather out of a mistaken understanding of the good. Augustine of Hippo famously wrestled with the problem of evil, concluding that evil is not a substance in itself but a <em>privatio boni</em>—a privation or absence of good.</p>

    <p>Friedrich Nietzsche challenged traditional morality, arguing that what we call "evil" often represents the life-affirming forces that Christianity had demonized. His critique questioned whether the concept of evil itself might be a tool of oppression used to constrain human potential.</p>

    <h2>The Psychology of Evil</h2>
    <p>In the 20th century, psychological experiments like Stanley Milgram's obedience studies and Philip Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment revealed disturbing truths about ordinary people's capacity for evil acts under certain conditions. These findings suggest that evil may not reside solely in "monsters," but in situations that can lead anyone astray.</p>

    <h2>Contemporary Understanding</h2>
    <p>Modern thinkers often approach evil through the lens of systemic analysis—institutional racism, economic exploitation, and environmental destruction represent forms of evil that operate beyond individual malice. Hannah Arendt's concept of the "banality of evil" reminds us that terrible acts can be committed by ordinary people simply following orders and conforming to bureaucratic norms.</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The nature of evil remains elusive, perhaps because it tells us more about ourselves than about any external force. By studying evil, we confront the depths of human capacity for harm—but also our equally profound capacity for compassion, justice, and transformation. Understanding evil is ultimately about understanding what we must strive against, and what we must strive to become.</p>
